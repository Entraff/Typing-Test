# Typing-Test
Test out your typing skills!

## Backstory
I had first gotten the idea to make a seemingly trivial project when I was on the plane,
and I wanted to practice a bit of typing. However, I soon realized I had no internet
available on the plane I was in. That is when I got the idea to make an offline typing
program so I would not have to rely on the internet for something so simple.
